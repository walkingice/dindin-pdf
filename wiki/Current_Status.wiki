What I am going to do with Dindin.

== Add GTK implementation ==
2009.03.20

*Add GTK support

  Let Dindin use GTK+ to get more power!!

== Move GLUT out ==
2009.02.26

*move GLUT into another implementat layer. (Done at 2009.3.20)

  I moved out GLUT from dindin.c into toolkit.c. However, it is not enough. toolkit.c should only be a abstract layer.
